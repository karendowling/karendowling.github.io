I am a new assistant professoer at TU Delft in the school of [Electrical Engineering, Math, and Computer Science](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs), in the [Microelectronics Department](http://microelectronics.tudelft.nl/). I am embedded in the [Electronics Instrumentation Laboratory](https://ei.et.tudelft.nl/), with a focus on integrating wide-bandgap materials for high precision and harsh-environment applications with ICs to enable novel microsystems with pratical implementations. I have a particular focus on magnetic field sensors that out-pace silicon Hall-effect sensors and survive harsher conditions.  I am hiring PhD student(s) and taking on current MS students for the 2022-23 year and beyond. If your research interests overlap, send me an email!

About Me
======
I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is home to the University of Michigan. Desiring nicer weather and ocean-front living, I got my B.S. degree in electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology in 2013. I then moved up to the SF Bay area and obtained my M.S. and PhD in EE from Stanford University in 2015 and 2019, respectively. My thesis focused on creating high quality magnetometers for extreme environments using Gallium Nitride, as well as some micromachining techniques in Silicon Carbide, both wide bandgap semiconductors. I then was a  postdoc at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), where I gained perspective on RF opto-electronic power devices known as photo-conductive semiconductor switches. I am now at TU Delft as an assistant professor as of August 2022.  Here, I am excited to combine both my love of sensors for harsh environments with optically coupled conduction mechanisms to open new avenues for high performing microsystems from fundamental research to device development and (someday) deployment.
