excerpt: "The most exciting element of sensor research is collecting new data in exciting collaborations. In order to do this, we need to create circuits with high-precision readout ability to collect high-quality data. Then we can deploy these devices in interesting environmetns (such as CubeSats, power transformers, and moters) <br/><img src='/images/DEPLOY.png'>"
