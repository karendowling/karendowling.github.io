title: "Theme 1: Fundamentals of (Ultra)-Wide Bandgaps"
excerpt: "I explore material properties and fabrication challenges with wide-bandgaps, such as machining of Silicon Carbide to create high-aspect ratio and 3D structures. Nanofabrication is fun, as pictured! I also look into material properties, such as high field physics of GaAs and GaN, to enable new sensing mechanisms. <br/><img src='/images/FUNDAMENTALS.png'>"
